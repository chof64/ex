This is a scratch file just to have some additional changes to be pushed.

I'm currently testing if the new workflow I've uploaded to the repository works
as intended.

Whats cool about this new change is that it aims to make release-it work with
only the config file and workflow. This means that the release-it package
doesn't need to be installed in the project.
