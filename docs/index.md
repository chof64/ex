# @chof64/ex

This is **@chof64/ex** - a personal experimental repository by [chof64](https://github.com/chof64).

## What is this?

This is **not** a documentation site. It's simply a collection of related (or perhaps unrelated) pages used to test various tools, libraries, and other technologies I've been curious about.

## Warning

**@chof64/ex** is intentionally messy and not particularly interesting. It exists solely for proof of concepts and experimentation purposes. Think of it as my digital scratch pad.

## No Support & No Collaboration

Please note:

- This repository is not open for collaboration
- Nothing found here is officially supported

## Current Experiments

### Release-it Integration

One of the experiments involves testing release-it to ensure it works as intended before implementing it in other projects.
